      <description>&lt;p&gt;I like to download those cheap albums on AmazonMP3 that are like “The 99 Darkest Classical Pieces” or whatever. The AmazonMP3 download, however, puts these mp3s in folders according to the artist instead of Various Artists or by album name. Because the Droid’s music player reads music based on the folder structure and not on the id3 tags, this means I have about 30 or 40 different entries for the same album. It’s annoying, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently decided to use Rhythmbox to pull all of the music from the Droid and then copy it back over to see if it would automatically put the mp3s in the correct folders. To my surprise,&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the first things I wanted to do when I got my netbook was to setup tethering.  However, I don’t want to pay $30 more a month just to view the same pages I’d otherwise be viewing on my phone (i.e. Facebook, Twitter, Google News/Gmail).  The answer to this is an application called EasyTether.  It’s currently only $10 on the Android Market.  &lt;a href=&#34;market://search?q=pname:com.mstream.easytether_beta&#34; title=&#34;Click here to download EasyTether&#34;&gt;Click here to download EasyTether&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The setup guide in EasyTether will walk you through getting the application configured on your phone and connecting that to your computer.  However, some people may have Linux-based NetBooks and not have the technical knowledge to write a simple script to startup ‘easytether’ in a console.  I’d like to provide those steps.  Please read on if you’re interested!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Note: You *MUST* have your sudo password to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
